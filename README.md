<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project (Updates 01/12/24)

In short, Fleur Fantasia is a full-stack e-commerce web app that allows users to browse and purchase different flower/plant options. 

- Like other common e-commerce applications, it supports filtering items, adding items to cart, checking out, etc with secure HTTPS communication. The app also supports credit card payment processing using Stripe API. 

- Unlike other common e-commerce applications, it also provides AI-powered tools to classify and detect different flower types. However, after considering the fact that the scope of the project is pretty big, I want to divide this feature into a different project!
