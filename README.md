<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In short, Fleur Fantasia is a full-stack e-commerce web app that allows users to browse different flower options. 

- Like other common e-commerce applications, it supports filtering items, adding items to cart, checking out, etc with secure HTTPS communication. The app also supports credit card payment processing using Stripe API. 

- Unlike other common e-commerce applications, it also provides AI-powered tools to classify and detect different flower types. 

I started this personal project with the aim to brush up my Java and Angular skills, and also to learn the Spring framework. In addition to that, as a person interested in using cutting-edge computer vision tools, I thought integrating deep learning models in this project would be a cool twist to a common e-commerce app!
